# # Configure file for cmd run of smoderp2d model. # #

# Smoderp2d can be executed (run) from the commandline on linux machine.

# Most of the input data have to be provided in pickle file 
# if smoderp2d is run in cmd mode. The pickle file is created 
# in data preparation only option is set in a give gis 
# software 

# If yo choose this option of running smoderp2d:
#   (1) Some parameters stored in pickle file cannot be changed.
#       Those inputs are set to "dash" in this configuration file.
#   (2) Some parameters are mandatory and used only for 
#       the cmd run. This is documented above affected parameters
