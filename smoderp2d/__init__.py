Documentation of Smoderp, distributed event-based model for surface and
subsurface runoff and erosion.

.. moduleauthor:: Petr Kavka, Karel Vrana and Jakub Jerabek
                  model was build in cooperation with eng. students
                  (Jan Zajicek, Nikola Nemcova, Tomas Edlman, Martin Neumann)

The computational options are as follows:
 - Type of flow
  - surface
   - subsurface
   - surface + subsurface
 - Flow direction algorithm
   - D8 (default)
   - multi-flow direction
 - Erosion
   - none
   - sheet erosion
   - sheet erosion + rill erosion
 - Stream
   - yes
   - no
