## How to test

Download SMODERP2D source code to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/storm-fsv-cvut/smoderp2d.git
```

### From Docker container

Build an image:

```bash
docker build -t smoderp docker/
```

Run SMODERP command line tool from Docker container:

```
docker run -v `pwd`:/opt/smoderp2d -w /opt/smoderp2d/ --rm --entrypoint \
 ./bin/start-smoderp2d.py smoderp \
 --config tests/quicktest.ini
```

### From command line locally

```
./bin/start-smoderp2d.py --config tests/quicktest.ini
```

### From GRASS GIS

Note: GRASS GIS 7.8+ required

Create testing mapset:

```
grass --text -c tests/grassdata/smoderp2d-location/test/
```

Run `r.smoderp2d` module:

```
./bin/grass/test_r_smoderp2d.py
```

### From ArcGIS 10.x or Pro

Launch SMODERP2D ArcToolbox from `bin\arcgis` directory.

![SMODERP2D ArcToolbox in action](img/arctoolbox.png?raw=true "SMODERP2D ArcToolbox in action")

### From QGIS

Quick test (on Linux):

```
QGIS_PLUGINPATH=`pwd`/bin/qgis qgis tests/data/projekt.qgs
```

Enable SMODERP2D plugin in `Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins...`.
