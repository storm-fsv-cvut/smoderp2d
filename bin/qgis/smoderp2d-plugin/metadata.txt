about=The SMODERP2D model is designed to calculate hydrological and erosion processes on individual plots or small catchments. The outputs of the model are primarily used to determine runoff conditions in a catchment and obtain parameters for runoff and erosion control measures on agricultural land. Additionally, the model can assist in designing more complex systems, including sediment retention ponds, dry basins, or polders. Its use complies with current methods, technical standards, and recommended practices.
